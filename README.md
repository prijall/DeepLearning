  # Day 1

  Deep Learning is the subset of Artificial Learning and Machine learning which is inspired by human brain and works on the concept of **Representational Learning**. That means, We don't have to do feature engineering like we do in machine learning, all we have to do is feed the proper and big data to deep learning algorithms and it will have layers which will automatically detect the features and then predicts.This is also the main difference between Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
  
  ### Key Difference Between Deep Learning and Machine Learning
 - **Data Dependecies:** Deep Learning need large data for prediction whereas minimal data can be used in machine learning.
 - **Hardware Dependencies:** Deep Learning is very slow with cpu only, hence need gpus with good memory whereas machine learning models can be train only on cpu.
 - **Training Time:** The training time for deep learning algorithm is very huge whereas ml model needs less training time.
 - **Feature Selection:** It is automatically done ny algo itself whereas feature engineering is manually done by humans in ml.
 - **Interpretability:** DL works in black box software engineering concpet so everything is hidden whereas in ml we know how we got that specific result.

 # Day 2
 
 In Deep Learning, the word deep means multiple hidden layers. Learning about the history of deep learning is very amazing. Deep Diving into the topic, today i learned about the certain types of neural network, they are; **Artificial Neural Network(ANN), Convoluational Neural Network(CNN), Recurrent Neural Network(RNN), etc.** All these have diiferent fucntionalities according to different use-cases. Multiple hidden neural network is later termed as **Deep Learning.**
